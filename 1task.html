    <h1>My Assests</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a friendly and confident person who's always eager to learn new things. I have a positive attitude and can easily speak in front of a crowd(with a little practice/context). I'm curious and open to new ideas. I may not know a lot of things but I will never back down from learning. I love being part of a team and working together with others. I'm a friendly, upbeat, and adaptable person who loves to learn and grow. Overall, I have a positive but practical outlook that helps me approach challenges with optimism while also finding realistic solutions to overcome them.
